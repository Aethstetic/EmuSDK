# EmuSDK
A simple SDK intended for people new to internal cheats. Written while I was drunk.
EmuSDK is licensed under the GNU GPLv2 Free Software License. Please include a copy of it if you use this in any of your releases.

This SDK features:
== A netvar manager to grab your offsets dynamically.
== An interface scanner (brute-force), with the option to use the interface you specified. (e.g GAMEEVENTSMANAGER002)
== A pasted D3D renderer, in case you want to go stream-proof and hook from gameoverlayrenderer.dll.
== Almost all of the classes you will require to develop an internal cheat in any 'direction' you desire. (e.g Legit, Rage, HvH)
== ImGUI, a beautiful menu that I found incredibly simple for beginners to use.

If you require support, please use the UC thread to post any requests for such.
